### To design effective microservices, some key principles should be followed:

1) Independence: Each service should be independent and self-contained, with its own database and codebase.

2) Isolation: Each service should be isolated from other services, and communication should happen through well-defined APIs.

3) Autonomy: Each service team should have the autonomy to choose the technology stack, deployment strategy, and scaling strategy.

4) Resilience: Each service should be designed to be resilient to failure, with fallbacks and retries in place.
